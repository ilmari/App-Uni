=head1 DESCRIPTION

  $ uni ☺
  263A ☺ WHITE SMILING FACE

  # Only on Perl 5.14+
  $ uni wry
  1F63C <U+1F63C> CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE

F<uni> has several modes of operation:

=head2 DWIM Mode

By default, F<uni> will interpret your arguments usefully.  If the only
argument is a single character, it will be looked up.  Otherwise, it will work
in name search mode, with the exception that search terms comprised entirely
of hex digits are allowed to match against the codepoint's numeric value.

=head2 Single Character Mode

  $ uni -s SINGLE-CHAR

This will print out the name and codepoint of the character.

  $ uni -s ¿
  ¿ - U+000BF - INVERTED QUESTION MARK

=head2 Name Search Mode

  $ uni -n SOME /SEARCH/ TERMS

This one will look for codepoints where each term appears as a (\b-bounded)
word in the name. If the term is bounded by slashes, it's treated as a regular
expression and is used to filter candidate codepoints by name.

  $ uni -n roman five
  Ⅴ - U+02164 - ROMAN NUMERAL FIVE
  Ⅾ - U+0216E - ROMAN NUMERAL FIVE HUNDRED
  ⅴ - U+02174 - SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL FIVE
  ⅾ - U+0217E - SMALL ROMAN NUMERAL FIVE HUNDRED
  ↁ - U+02181 - ROMAN NUMERAL FIVE THOUSAND

=head2 String Decomposition

  $ uni -c SOME STRINGS

This prints out the codepoints in each string, with a blank line between each
argument's codepoints.

  $ uni -c Hey リコ
  H - U+00048 - LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H
  e - U+00065 - LATIN SMALL LETTER E
  y - U+00079 - LATIN SMALL LETTER Y

  リ- U+030EA - KATAKANA LETTER RI
  コ- U+030B3 - KATAKANA LETTER KO

=head2 Lookup By Codepoint

  $ uni -u NUMBERS IN HEX

This prints out the codepoint for each given hex value.

  $ uni -u FF 1FF 10FF
  ÿ - U+000FF - LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS
  ǿ - U+001FF - LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH STROKE AND ACUTE
  ჿ - U+010FF - GEORGIAN LETTER LABIAL SIGN

=head1 NOTES

If you'd like to search for Emojis in Unicode 6.0, please upgrade to Perl 5.14!

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This is a re-implementation of a program written by Audrey Tang in Taiwan.  I
used that program for years before deciding I wanted to add a few features,
which I did by rewriting from scratch.

That program, in turn, was a re-implementation of a same-named program Larry
copied to me, which accompanied Audrey for years.  However, that program was
lost during a hard disk failure, so she coded it up from memory.

Thank-you, Larry, for everything. ♡
